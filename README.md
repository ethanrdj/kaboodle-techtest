# kaBooking.com - Ethan Davis Tech Test

## Description

This project is a small application that uses JSON data to create a website similar to Booking.com. It allows users to view a list of hotels and sort them by star rating, price, or alphabetically. Users can also navigate to a specific hotel page to view more details, including a description, full address with a button to link to Google Maps, and room details.

### Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Redux/Redux Toolkit
- Chakra UI

### Features

- Utilises mock service worker to mock network requests
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop

### Future Improvements

If more time were available, different filtering methods and possibly a search feature could be implemented, rather than just sorting by star rating, price, and name.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project and any dependencies required:

```bash
npm install
```
